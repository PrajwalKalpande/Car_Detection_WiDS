# Car_Detection_WiDS
## Autonomous Driving- Car Detection project done under WiDS 2021-22
YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. In this project, I made use of YOLO for detecting objects in images. This repo includes two colab notebooks(links are also given in the project report attached).
> Check the *Report.pdf* for a detailed explanation of the project

How to run:

1. Click on "Open in Colab" in the colab notebook 
2. Save a copy to your Google Colab account
3. Download the [car.zip dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sshikamaru/car-object-detection) and save it in your Google Drive (*only for Object_detection_using_pretrainedYolov5.ipynb*)
4. Follow the instructions in the files and run them
5. Done!
