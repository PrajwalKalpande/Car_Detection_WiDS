# Car_Detection_WiDS
## Autonomous Driving- Car Detection project done under WiDS 2021-22
YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. In this project, I made use of YOLO for detecting objects in images. This repo includes two colab notebooks(links are also given in the project report attached).

How to run:

1. Click on the colab notebook links.
2. Save a copy to your Google Colab account.
3. Download the [car.zip dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sshikamaru/car-object-detection) and save it in your Google Drive (*only for Object_detection_using_pretrainedYolov5.ipynb*)
4. Follow the instructions in the files and run them.
done!
